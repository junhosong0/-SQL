**내코딩**
```sql
SELECT CATEGORY, SUM(SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM BOOK b
    LEFT JOIN BOOK_SALES s
    ON b.BOOK_ID = s.BOOK_ID
WHERE LEFT(SALES_DATE, 7) = '2022-01'
GROUP BY CATEGORY
ORDER BY CATEGORY
```


**배울것**
```sql
SELECT CATEGORY, SUM(SALES) as TOTAL_SALES
FROM BOOK JOIN BOOK_SALES USING(BOOK_ID)
WHERE SALES_DATE LIKE "2022-01%"
GROUP BY CATEGORY
ORDER BY CATEGORY
```
JOIN ON 대신 JOIN USING써서 심플하게 작성 한 것
WHERE 절은 LIKE를 사용함
